**Each project contains dataset, task description, and a sample solution with .ipynb file and a report.**
**Project4 [Paper Discussion](#4-paper-discussion) contains a NLP paper and the paper dissection.**

## 1. Language identification with sklearn and skorch
This exercise consists of two parts: the first part aims at deepening your understanding of linear models. The
second part will already target a simple kind of multi-layered network; the multilayer perceptron (MLP).

## 2. Building Word Embeddings
In this project, we focus on building word embeddings using techniques CBOW on two datasets. The embeddings are evaluated manually through computing the nearest neighbours.

## 3. Emotion Recognition CNN

This project involves working on the Twitter Emotion Recognition task. The goal of this task is to infer the affectual state of a person from their tweet. The task is to implement an emotion recognition classifier in PyTorch or PyTorch Lightning. 

## 4. Paper Discussion
This directory contains a research papers related to machine learning and NLP, and a dissection illustrate the key information of the paper.

## 5. Sequence and Anger Regression
Implement a named entity recognition system through fine-tune a pretrained BERT-base model in Hugging Face, then using it to detect anger in English regression task.

## 6. Topic Modeling
This project focuses on unsupervised learning techniques for topic modeling. Different algorithms like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) are used to discover hidden topics in a collection of documents.

## ACL
This directory contains various resources and projects related to the ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) conferences. It includes papers, presentations, and additional materials that are relevant to the course.
